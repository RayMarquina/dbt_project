      threads: 4              # max number of models to run concurrently. acceptable values between 1 and 8.

      schema: my_model_schema # the schema to create models in. commonly "dbt_" + a suffix for development, and "analytics" for production
  run-target: my-target       # default target; can be overridden at run time.

# create a second profile. You can switch to this profile in the CLI with --profile my-org
# Valid dbt options include:
# dbt debug --profile my-org # use my-org profile with default "dev" run target
# dbt debug --profile my-org --target dev # explicitly use "dev" run target
# dbt debug --profile my-org --target prod # switch to the "prod" run target
# these flags work with `dbt (debug|compile|run|test)` as you would expect!
