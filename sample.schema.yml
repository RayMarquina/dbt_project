# This is a sample schema definition which can go in a model directory
# There are three types of validations
#  - Not null
#  - Unique 
#  - Referential integrity
#
# This file (schema.yml) should go in the models/your-model/ directory
# To run it, execute one of the following commands
#
# $ dbt test --validate
# $ dbt test --skip-test-creates --validate

people:
  constraints:
    # check number of times these fields are null (should be 0)
    not_null:
      - id
      - account_id
      - name

    # count number of non-unique `id` fields (should be 0)
    unique:
      - id

    # count number of rows where `people.account_id` points to a nonexistent `accounts.id` (should be 0)
    relationships:
      - {from: account_id, to: accounts, field: id}

accounts:
  constraints:
    not_null:
      - id
      - domain
